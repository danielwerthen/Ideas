# Abstract - WIP

This talk has the ambitious goal of convincing you that there in fact is a far simpler approach to system development, that will eliminate much of the complexity inherit to many of the system in production today. 

The foundation for this approach is to view the system as a collection of events with causal relationships. The viewpoint is agnostic to any singular computational device and tries to, as far as possible, map to simple logical constructs. 

This viewpoint, we will show, offers a substantial and in many ways new line of communication between management and developers.
