**Title of presentation:** Finding simple solutions to complex software

**Abstract:** The scale of the software being built today often transcends the understanding of any single individual, as it is getting increasingly complex. How can a simple strategy be leveraged to change this trend? 

We propose a radically simplified framework of only a handful of rules which can be used to generalize software, by providing a higher level of abstraction.
Not only is this framework derived from the way we reason about causality, it is also making the very bold statement of being able to describe any given system.

In this presentation we will describe this framework, from the perspective of management and development.
