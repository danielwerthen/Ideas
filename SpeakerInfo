**Title of presentation:** Finding a simple solution to complex software

**Abstract:** The scale of software of today and tomorrow transcends the understanding of any single individual, often quite literally so.
How can a simple strategy be leveraged to change this trend? 

We propose a radically simplified framework of only a handful of rules which can be used to generalize software and provied a new and higher level of abstraction.
Not only is this framework derived from the way we reason about causality, it is also making the very bold statement of being able to describe any given system.

In this presentation we will describe this framework, both from the perspective of management and developers.
